     <div class="passage1">
      As a child, reading is something that I value, that I enjoy. Books are a craving, they are necessary for me to focus, they are entertaining, engaging, and reading them is an experience that can be challenged by no other. Everyone knows about what can be gained from reading. The benefits, from simply picking up a book. However, to attain those great things, you must have that spark, that drive. Too often nowadays do I encounter other young people who dislike and even hate reading. Who loathe it rather than love it, who dread it rather than welcome it. To those of you like this, I want to share with you the bliss I feel from the words on those pages, and in this way, help you gain all the benefits that you can from books, both mentally (in your imagination) and academically. Who knows, it may ripple into other factors of your life. I hope that this website can help me achieve that goal. A book can change a person, and there is one for everyone.

     <p>About "The Crossroads of Reading"</p>
     <div class="passage2">
      The Crossroads of Reading is a book recommendation site, focused on trying to encourage reading in all walks of life by providing everyone with book options that they can enjoy. It allows users to add to the library, and broadcasts well favored books across the board. We sort our books by age (instead of the usual classification of genre), therefore providing a “reading ladder” for younger children and parents to climb up together and making it easier for new readers of any age to find their preference without knowing what genre they favor. In addition, this allows avid readers searching for their next read to come and find it, without knowing exactly what they are looking for. This style also does not hinder those who know what book is right for them.
