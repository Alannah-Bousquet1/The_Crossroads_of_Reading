      Imager is the beginning of a whole new fantasy in a whole new magical <br>
      world from the bestselling creator of Recluce. Although Rhennthyl <br>
      is the son of a leading wool merchant in L’Excelsis, the capital <br>
      of Solidar, the most powerful nation on Terahnar, he has spent years<br>
      becoming a journeyman artist and is skilled and diligent enough to be <br>
      considered for the status of master artisan—in another two years.<br>
      Then, in a single moment, his entire life is transformed when his <br>
      master patron is killed in a flash fire, and Rhenn discovers he is an <br>
      imager—one of the few in the entire world of Terahnar who can visualize<br>
      things and make them real.<br>
      <br>
      He must leave his family and join the Collegium of Imagisle.  Imagers<br>
      live separately from the rest of society because of their abilities <br>
      (they can do accidental magic even while asleep), and because they are <br>
      both feared and vulnerable. In this new life, Rhenn discovers that all <br>
      too many of the “truths” he knew were nothing of the sort. Every day <br>
      brings a new threat to his life.  He makes a powerful enemy while <br>
      righting a wrong, and begins to learn to do magic in secret. Imager is <br>
      the innovative and enchanting opening of an involving new fantasy story.<br>

      In this stunning new book, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual journey through the world of "outliers"--the best and the brightest, the most famous and the most successful. He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different?<br>
      <br>
      His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.

      Just after midnight, a snowdrift stops the Orient Express in its tracks. The luxurious train is surprisingly full for the time of the year, but by the morning it is one passenger fewer. An American tycoon lies dead in his compartment, stabbed a dozen times, his door locked from the inside.<br>
      <br>
      Isolated and with a killer in their midst, detective Hercule Poirot must identify the murderer—in case he or she decides to strike again.

     Set amid the austere beauty of the North Carolina coast begins the story of Noah Calhoun, a rural Southerner recently returned from the Second World War. Noah is restoring a plantation home to its former glory, and he is haunted by images of the beautiful girl he met fourteen years earlier, a girl he loved like no other. Unable to find her, yet unwilling to forget the summer they spent together, Noah is content to live with only memories...until she unexpectedly returns to his town to see him once again.<br>
     <br>
     Like a puzzle within a puzzle, the story of Noah and Allie is just the beginning. As it unfolds, their tale miraculously becomes something different, with much higher stakes. The result is a deeply moving portrait of love itself, the tender moments and the fundamental changes that affect us all. It is a story of miracles and emotions that will stay with you forever.
